> **Baseline:** 2026-11-03. Revise this document whenever measured capacity, deployment topology, repository ownership, or product requirements materially change.

## 0. Operating principle

Build **one connected Owj platform**, not one tightly coupled application. Favor reliable user-facing business operations over background throughput. Optimize within today's **single 4-vCPU, ~7.8-GiB-RAM Ubuntu VPS**; keep component boundaries clean so services can be relocated later without rewriting domain logic.

**Directive strength:** **MUST** = required; **SHOULD** = strong default; **MAY** = optional after evidence. If a request conflicts with a MUST, describe the conflict and propose a safe alternative before implementing.

## 1. Facts, planned changes, and discovery

### Confirmed current facts

- Host: **4 vCPUs, ~7.8 GiB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04**, no swap in the last snapshot; approximately **29 GB root disk**. Media/large assets use a separate S3-compatible bucket. Keep an eye on local MongoDB growth, indexes, logs, images, and build cache regardless.
- Running production containers in the last snapshot: `web-app-1`, `web-chat-1`, `web-nginx-1`, `web-mongo-1`. The Web application used roughly **1.1 GiB** at idle/low load; Chat roughly **50 MiB**, MongoDB roughly **198 MiB**. These are **not peak-load benchmarks**.
- Existing Docker containers have **no explicit memory or CPU limits**. Docker's current logging driver is `json-file`; build cache was approximately **7.2 GB**. Do not assume resource isolation or log rotation already exists.
- Web is a **Next.js 15** business platform with users/roles, auth, listings (`Poster`), consultants/agencies, CRM cases/tasks, and media. It currently composes the sibling Chat service and local MongoDB 8.
- Chat is a separate sibling repository providing chat HTTP/Socket.IO functionality; its internals require a dedicated audit. Web also has a **legacy `/api/chatroom`** route, separate from the Chat service's `/api/chat/*` and `/socket.io/*`.
- Analytics currently uses **MongoDB Atlas for testing** and stores sanitized Divar public listings, observations, crawler state, and runs. **Moving Analytics data to the local MongoDB host is a desired migration, not yet a completed fact.**
- Analytics targets **168 approved Tehran areas**; historical collection coverage, lifecycle reconciliation, and scoring-model confidence still need improvement.

### Target architecture (implement incrementally)

- **Docker Compose** on one host; separate deployable Web, Chat, Analytics API, crawler worker, and incremental-scoring worker processes.
- **One local MongoDB engine** with separately owned *logical databases* (proposed: `owj_business`, `owj_chat`, `owj_analytics`) and least-privilege credentials; avoid multiple MongoDB processes on the same small host. **Do not rename/move current databases without a migration and rollback.**
- **Web is the identity authority and owner of business mutations**. Other services use authenticated API contracts; do not directly write another service's collections.
- Prefer lean host monitoring and durable background jobs before adding Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Swarm, Prometheus/Loki stacks, or other resource-intensive infrastructure.

**At the start of every task:** Identify the active repository, affected service, current versus target behavior, its authoritative data owner, expected user-facing latency, and whether the change adds CPU, RAM, disk I/O, database queries, connections, or external requests. Inspect code before asserting a capability is already implemented.

## 2. Repository boundaries and database ownership

| Service | Owns | Must NOT own/do |
|---|---|---|
| **Web** | Account identity, sessions, permissions, roles, agencies, consultants, business `Poster` advertisements, CRM customers/cases/tasks/activity, business workflows | Read/write Chat's private messages or Analytics ingestion collections directly merely for convenience |
| **Chat** | Conversations, messages, delivery/read state, realtime transport | Mutate Web CRM collections or implement duplicate CRM authorization; maintain an independent Owj user identity store |
| **Analytics** | Sanitized public listing observations, extraction state, public market search, model versions, valuations/scores, analytical aggregates | Store contact/advertiser identity; write Web `Poster`, user, CRM, or Chat records |
| **Infrastructure** | Compose/deployment wiring, networks, health checks, resource controls, logs, backups | Own domain rules or include production secrets in the repository |

- **MUST** have one documented owner for every collection/schema and for each state transition.
- **MUST** use an owning service's authenticated API or event contract for cross-repository actions. Shared MongoDB *infrastructure* is **not** authorization to access all its databases.
- **MUST** use separate DB users/roles per service where feasible. Never reuse MongoDB root credentials inside ordinary app services.
- **MUST NOT** import another repository's Mongoose model to bypass the owning API.
- **MUST NOT** assume separate logical MongoDB databases provide CPU/I/O isolation; they still share the same `mongod` process and disk.
- **SHOULD** retain a single local MongoDB process initially. Consider physical separation only when benchmarks show contention or uptime requirements demand it.
- Define cross-repository contracts with versioned JSON schemas/OpenAPI/TypeScript types **without sharing internal ORM models**. Changes require consumer compatibility tests and migration notes.

## 3. Identity, authentication, authorization, and user actions

- **Web remains the canonical identity authority.** Chat and Analytics MUST NOT create a second user-registration or password/OTP database.
- User-initiated private/business actions MUST be authenticated by Web or verified against Web-issued, audience-restricted identity. Permissions MUST be checked for the requested resource/scope on **every mutation**.
- **Never trust `userId`, `role`, `agencyId`, or `consultantId` supplied by the browser** as authoritative. Derive the actor from a verified session/token and re-check current role/account/agency status where needed.
- **Do not distribute Web's JWT signing secret to every service.** Prefer a Web BFF for authenticated operations on today's architecture; if independent token verification is needed, design short-lived audience-limited tokens with asymmetric verification or another audited mechanism.
- Internal service-to-service requests MUST use authenticated service identities and least-privilege scope; distinguish the service identity from the initiating human user. Protect internal APIs from public exposure.
- Standardize legacy `token` vs `Authorization: Bearer` handling before new integrations; do not silently weaken old route permissions.
- **Chat -> Web CRM task:** Chat calls a Web-owned authorized API. Web checks actor, state transitions, assignee permissions, and records CRM activity. Add an idempotency key; do not treat a correlation ID alone as deduplication.
- **Analytics -> consultant 'Save to My Panel':** Search may run in Analytics, but **saving is a Web-owned authenticated operation**. Store a `(userId, source, listingToken)` association in Web's own collection, with a unique compound index and optionally a sanitized public snapshot. Analytics does **not** need a user database.
- Saving an external public listing is **NOT** the same as publishing a Web `Poster`. Creating a `Poster` requires the existing verified ownership/contact, validation, and approval workflow. **Never fabricate identity/contact information** to satisfy its schema.
- Enforce role/scope-based access to private chat, CRM, inspections, and uploads. Add abuse protection and rate limits for login, OTP, API, and uploads.

## 4. Analytics public-data privacy — non-negotiable

- Collect only from **unauthenticated public Divar endpoints** explicitly allowed by the project's public extraction design; do not call contact/chat endpoints or access authenticated information.
- **Never retain**: phone numbers, contact objects, advertiser/agency names or identities, credentials, access tokens, cookies, authenticated responses, or contact/chat actions from Divar.
- Sanitize descriptions **before** persistence; use the explicit extraction attribute allowlist. Apply the same controls to error logs, traces, queue payloads, test fixtures, exports, caches, and backups.
- Store only safe image metadata as permitted by the analytics schema; do not ingest personal identifiers through fallback extraction.
- Respect access restrictions and reasonable request rates; do not evade protective controls. Throttle and stop on repeated errors or access-policy signals.
- Web's own CRM/Chat legitimately handles customer data, but **Analytics must not receive or retain that identity data**. Cross-service search should use sanitized search criteria, not CRM profiles/phone numbers.
- Voice input/transcripts SHOULD be ephemeral by default; do not persist raw audio/transcripts or send private CRM details to third parties without explicit design and approvals.

## 5. Resource budget and performance on the CURRENT VPS

**Hard constraint:** 4 shared vCPUs, ~7.8 GiB physical RAM. Protect interactive Web/Chat/CRM over crawler throughput. No service may assume it has the entire host.

**Provisional test ceilings — NOT production-proven settings and NOT reservations:**

| Container/process | Initial memory ceiling to test |
|---|---:|
| Web app | **2.0 GiB** |
| Single local MongoDB engine | **1.5 GiB** |
| Chat | **0.4 GiB** |
| Analytics API | **0.5 GiB** |
| Crawler | **0.6 GiB** |
| Incremental scorer | **0.8 GiB** |
| Nginx + tiny agents | **0.2 GiB** |
| **Total container ceilings** | **~6.0 GiB** |
| **Remaining for host, cache, spikes** | **~1.8 GiB** |

- **MUST** measure RSS, peak memory, CPU, event-loop delay, MongoDB latency, and API p95 *before* enforcing/tightening ceilings. An OOM kill is a failed capacity assumption, not an acceptable normal operating mode.
- **MUST** bound concurrency, arrays/batches, queues, file sizes, HTTP response sizes, MongoDB connection pools, and third-party request rates.
- **MUST NOT** run full model retraining, unbounded backfill, or large citywide analytics computations on a user-facing request path.
- **MUST** isolate crawler and scoring from the Web/Chat processes. Separate containers/processes should have independent restarts and checkpoints.
- **SHOULD** begin with one active crawl-area discovery job, small permitted detail-fetch concurrency, one incremental scorer, and small database-write batches; increase only after observing resource and service latency metrics.
- **SHOULD** throttle/pause background work if RAM headroom, CPU, MongoDB latency, disk, or CRM p95 deteriorates. Prefer explicit backpressure and durable retries to crashing the host.
- **SHOULD** train models in a separate scheduled job, reducing or stopping crawler/scorer concurrency during training on this VPS. Benchmark required training RAM first.
- **SHOULD** build Docker images in CI/off-host and deploy immutable tagged images, avoiding CPU/RAM-intensive production builds.
- **MUST NOT** add Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch, K8s/K3s, Swarm, Loki, full Prometheus, or other infrastructure by default. Require a measured bottleneck, cost/resource budget, and rollback plan.

## 6. Database and query rules

- **MUST** use selective projections, indexes based on real query patterns, bounded pagination/cursors, and `lean()` for suitable read-only Mongoose queries.
- **MUST NOT** load entire collections via `find({})` or massive arrays into Node memory for filtering/scoring/search. Prefer server-side indexed queries, small batches, streaming/cursors, and precomputed read models.
- **MUST** inspect `explain('executionStats')` for newly expensive queries. Review documents examined versus returned, sort strategy, latency, and index maintenance overhead.
- **MUST** make ingestion idempotent: use unique listing token, safe upserts, revisions/change fingerprints, deduplicated observations where appropriate, and retryable checkpoints.
- **MUST** keep transactions short and necessary; distinguish document-level atomicity from multi-document consistency. Verify deployment topology before using change streams or transactions (MongoDB replica set requirements).
- **MUST** reuse MongoDB clients/pools instead of creating a new connection per request or document. Bound connections; never blindly increase `maxPoolSize` to fix a latency problem.
- **MUST** make schema/index migrations explicit, versioned, backed up, tested, and reversible wherever possible. Do not drop/rename business collections or change login behavior as part of an Analytics feature.
- **SHOULD** use separate credentials for Web, Chat, and Analytics DB access; never grant Analytics access to business PII collections.
- **SHOULD** use one MongoDB process on this small host; tune WiredTiger cache and memory limits only after confirming the actual config and taking a tested backup.
- **SHOULD** precompute market aggregates and searchable latest scores; don't recompute them on every page load or voice query.

## 7. Crawler, history, and scoring reliability

- Split crawler discovery into **fair, resumable per-area jobs** for all 168 approved Tehran areas; no alphabetical starvation. Keep durable area checkpoints and bounded retries with backoff/jitter.
- Separate current discovery from optional public-detail enrichment and historical backfill; lower-priority work must not starve discovery or critical user traffic.
- Do not equate a failed or partial crawl with evidence that unseen listings disappeared. Lifecycle reconciliation must use sufficiently complete, reliable crawl coverage.
- Record `lastSeen`, listing revision, extraction provenance, completeness/quality flags, and meaningful changes; do not repeatedly rescore unchanged properties.
- Queue scoring asynchronously after relevant updates, coalesce duplicate work, and use revision-aware/idempotent jobs. Ensure crashes between listing writes and job publication are recoverable (outbox or reconciliation scan).
- Distinguish **model training**, **incremental valuation**, and **interactive search ranking**. Search should use indexed records and **precomputed**, versioned scores; never fit the model during a request.
- Save score/model version, listing revision, timestamp, confidence, provenance, and freshness; never silently mix incompatible model versions as equivalent rankings.
- Current price-model validation is experimental, **not production-approved**. Present estimates as estimates, with uncertainty and data freshness; do not claim guaranteed bargains or market-wide coverage.
- The Analytics dataset has incomplete descriptions, historical details, uncertain advertiser classification, and incomplete area coverage. Do not treat `unknown` advertiser type as business/personal or trust all `active` lifecycle labels until reconciliation is reliable.

## 8. Cross-service messaging, events, and API contracts

- Use **synchronous authenticated APIs for commands requiring a confirmed result**, such as Chat creating a CRM task or Web saving a market listing.
- Use **asynchronous durable events/jobs for side effects** (notification, score refresh, analytics snapshot). Define event version, unique event ID, source, timestamp, correlation ID, and minimal non-sensitive payload.
- Producers MUST NOT declare success before the owning service acknowledges business completion. Consumers MUST be idempotent; retries must not create duplicate CRM tasks, alerts, or observations.
- Do not place CRM customer contact information, full private chat text, credentials, or prohibited Divar data on broadly consumed events.
- Timeouts, retries with bounded exponential backoff, idempotency, and a clear fallback/error message are required for service-to-service calls.
- Prefer API contract tests (request/response schema, authorization, error cases, idempotency) over tightly coupled cross-repo imports.

## 9. Deployment, operations, monitoring, and security

- **MUST** use Docker Compose for the current single-host deployment. Do not add an orchestrator unless requirements exceed Compose and more nodes exist.
- **MUST** deploy independently restartable services with health/readiness checks, restart policies, private networks, and only necessary public ports through Nginx.
- **MUST** configure and verify per-service memory/CPU limits once baseline load tests confirm settings; never assume Compose files from another repo enforce limits globally.
- **MUST** rotate and bound container logs. Do not deploy unbounded local logs/metrics retention on the shared VPS.
- **MUST** use structured logs with `service`, timestamp, severity, event, and correlation/request ID. Redact secrets, OTPs, passwords, private messages, PII, and prohibited crawler data.
- **SHOULD** monitor: host RAM available, memory RSS, container restarts/OOMs, CPU, MongoDB read/write p95, connection pools, Web/CRM API p95, Chat connection health, crawler queue lag/area completion, scoring freshness, disk remaining, and backup success.
- **MUST** keep `.env`, DB URIs, signing secrets, S3 keys, SMS credentials, and access tokens out of code, logs, commits, tests, screenshots, and shared examples. Maintain a redacted `.env.example` with names only.
- **MUST** use least-privilege service DB credentials and narrowly scoped API identities. Never expose MongoDB publicly.
- **MUST** back up MongoDB and required local metadata off-host, protect S3 assets appropriately, and periodically test restore. S3 media storage does not protect local database records or indexes.
- **MUST** avoid destructive deployment patterns (`git reset --hard` on live mutable code, unverified migrations, clearing volumes, `docker system prune --volumes`). Require an explicit tested rollback for risky changes.
- **SHOULD** use CI to test/build immutable Docker images; rollout should confirm readiness and preserve a known-good version.

## 10. Minimum tests and acceptance checks for each change

Before marking work complete, run the relevant checks or explain precisely what could not be run:

1. **Ownership:** Is the changed collection/API owned by this repository? Are consumers affected?
2. **Privacy:** Are public Divar data allowlisted and sanitized? Are logs, queue payloads, tests, and exports free from forbidden data?
3. **Security:** Does the operation authenticate and authorize the real actor? Are service credentials scoped? Is browser-provided identity untrusted?
4. **Correctness:** Are changes idempotent or retry-safe? Are partial failures and repeated requests handled?
5. **Performance:** Are queries indexed/bounded? Are memory use, concurrency, and CPU work bounded? Is work off the critical request path when appropriate?
6. **Compatibility:** Are migrations versioned and backward-compatible where possible? Are Web/Chat/Analytics API contracts preserved?
7. **Recovery:** Can the worker resume after a restart? Is durable state consistent? Is a rollback possible?
8. **Verification:** Run relevant lint, typecheck, unit/integration/contract tests and a small resource/performance smoke test; report actual results, not assumptions.

### Coding-agent response format

For nontrivial work, report briefly:

- **Repository/service:** what changed and which domain owns it.
- **Files/contracts/migrations:** exact paths; any newly introduced collection, endpoint, job, permission, or dependency.
- **Resource impact:** expected RAM/CPU/query/connection/I/O effects and concurrency limits.
- **Security/privacy:** actor validation and cross-service data boundary.
- **Verification:** tests run and results; remaining gaps and deployment/rollback notes.

## 11. Change-control rules for growing later

Update this file when any of these occur:

- VPS CPU/RAM/disk is upgraded or a second node is introduced.
- Analytics migration from Atlas to local MongoDB completes.
- Chat database ownership is audited and separated from legacy `/api/chatroom`.
- An identity protocol, message broker, dedicated search engine, or orchestrator is introduced.
- Actual load testing justifies changing memory/CPU budgets, scoring freshness targets, or crawler concurrency.

**Do not silently turn future architecture into current fact.** For proposed changes, document migration steps, compatibility, measurement, fallback, and rollback first.
